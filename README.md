Advent of Code 2017

My humble attempt the advent of code 2017, and a good excuse to play in github, learn go, and some other languages.

The organization of this repo will be as follows
  dayX
   lang/
     <code files>

So, If I am ambitious enough to do days in multiple languages it will probably look something like this:
  day1/  
    go/  
      .. some code  
    rust/  
      ... code  
    haskell/  
       ... code
